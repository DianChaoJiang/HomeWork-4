<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;">HomeWork 4</h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Hall of fame by The Script</p>


<P style="color:DodgerBlue;">First of all, my homework4 and my homework3 songs are different songs. The reason I chose this song is because it often helps me when I'm desperate. The lyrics of this song are very inspirational and the accompaniment is very inspiring. Whether it is at the final or midterm, I will listen to this song while reviewing, because this song allows me to tell myself, yes, you can do it! .</P>
